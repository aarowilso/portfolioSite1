spartaTitle: The New Audible
spartaDescription: >
   I teamed up with two great designers at Audible to reimagine the app. For two months we spent our 20% time designing a radically new experience. We presented to the VPs of the company and were met with outright applause. Many of the ideas are making their way into the live app.

paragraphTitle: Paragraph Club
paragraphDescription: >
   Paragraph Club is a side project I started to help friends do a better job of keeping in touch. Every two weeks you get a letter from a friend about their life and thoughts. I recruited friends at Amazon, Medium, and Quartz to design and build the beta with me.

gloveTitle: Glove for Android
gloveDescription: >
  I joined the CrowdX team in Tel Aviv for three months to design Glove, an app to help people find their best wireless carrier based on where they use their phone. We designed the app that summer and launched later that year. Glove helped CrowdX grow to the point that the team just had a very successful exit.

myregistryDescription: >
  I joined MyRegistry for a year as Director of UX. We completely overhauled the site and apps and launched MyRegistry 2.0 which led to doubling our number of monthly new users and tripling the size of the team. It was a crazy, fun ride.
