            <p>    
            That's a fancy way of saying I'm a UX designer who does every stage of product design, from idea to mockups to prototype. Before my recent move to Israel, I was in NYC, working at <a href="http://about.audible.com" target="_blank"> Audible</a> (part of <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank"> Amazon</a>). I designed and shipped Audible Channels to a few million users and did a lot of work with the <a href="http://prime.amazon.com" target="_blank"> Amazon Prime</a> team. I get very passionate about the things I work on. </p>
